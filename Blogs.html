            <p>Coding has exploded in recent years, changing from something used in computer games and the occasional
                electronic device, to something which shapes the way that we live in the modern world. This means that
                now is an excellent time for learning how to code for beginners.
                <br>
                Pretty much every device, electronic item, and modern piece of machinery contains at least a little bit
                of code. As the number of use cases for coding grows, the number of coding jobs available will also
                continue to grow.
                <br> We will begin by defining what coding is and why you should learn it. After this, we will move into
                a
                step by step guide to coding for dummies.

            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516387938699-a93567ec168e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&w=1000&q=80"
                alt="img-2" width="300px" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
            <p>Although coding is relatively easy to learn compared to a lot of other technical skills, it is still
                something that scares people.

                At first glance, it may seem complicated, confusing, and very, very hard to master. I mean, how do you
                go about learning how to code a website if you have no programming experience whatsoever?

                The answer is simple - you follow our step by step guide to learning how to code for beginners! By the
                end of this guide, you should have a clear understanding of the steps that are required if you want to
                become a programmer, along with the things that you can do to help fast-track your journey.
                <br> <br>
            <h3>Step 1: Work Out Why You Want To Learn How To Code</h3>
            Now, the first thing that you need to do - before you even think about enrolling in courses or starting to
            watch YouTube videos about coding - is to ask yourself why you want to learn to code.

            Sit down and think carefully about what you hope to get out of it, why coding is a skill that you want to
            learn, and how much time and money you have to commit to it.

            <ol> <b>Consider:</b>
                <li><b>What sort of skills you want to end up with. </b>Do you want to become a <b> website
                        developer?</b> Or perhaps you would prefer to be able to build mobile apps or work in software
                    engineering? You will need to think carefully about this because it will largely dictate the
                    languages that you are going to learn.</li>
                <li><b> website developer?</b>Is learning how to code simply something which interests you that you are
                    going to be doing in your spare time? Or is programming something that you would like to pursue a
                    career in further down the track?</li>
                <li><b>How much time and money you can commit. </b> If you are only going to have a couple of hours per
                    week to commit to learning how to code, there probably isn’t a whole lot of point enrolling in an
                    intensive course. In the same way, if you want to join an intensive course with support, you will
                    have to be prepared to pay for it.
                    <br><b>Identify and write down your coding goals</b> and store them somewhere safe. These will
                    quickly become the basis of your journey from novice to master coder.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p> <br>

            <h3>Step 2: Choose The Right Languages</h3>
            <img src="https://www.seoclerk.com/pics/499379-2aCMQj1482146335.jpg" alt="img-3" width="200px"
                style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
            <p>Different types of programming require different skills. For example, if you want to learn how to code a
                website, you should learn languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and php. <br> Likewise, mobile app
                development requires Java (for Android) or Swift (for iOS). Choosing the right language is extremely
                important, which is why we have outlined some of the most popular among beginners below: <br> <br> <br>

            <h4>HTML</h4>
            If you want to get into front-end web development, then you have to learn HTML. Used for marking up text so
            that computers can understand it, HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language) is one of the simplest languages to
            learn and is where a lot of people start learning how to code. <br><br>

            <h4>CSS</h4>
            CSS is used almost <b>exclusively alongside HTML </b> to style and format content on webpages. It allows you
            to do things like change the color and size of elements, change the position of elements on a webpage, and
            change the entire layout of a webpage.
            Like HTML, <b>CSS is essential</b> if you plan on becoming a front-end web developer. <br><br>

            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            JavaScript is another language that is quite versatile and extremely widespread - much like Java and Python.
            <br>
            Although it has historically been a front-end web development language that allowed the creation of
            interactive elements, JavaScript is becoming increasingly used for other things - including back-end web
            development. <br><br>

            <h4>Python</h4>
            Python is super versatile, and it has a lot of different uses. A lot of academics and researchers use Python
            to create data analysis programs to help their studies.
            <br>
            It is also behind the rise of new technologies like <b> artificial intelligence and machine learning.</b> It
            is <b> easy to learn</b> , and it is the most popular language taught in schools. That's why it's perfect
            for those who are looking for how to code for beginners.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 3: Choose The Right Resources To Help You Learn.</h3>
            <img src="image/learn from book.jpg" alt="img-4" width="185px" style="float: right;">
            <p><b>Textbooks:</b> Code reference books are a great resource that <b>every single beginner should make use
                    of.</b> They contain all of the syntax and conventions of a language, allowing you to look things up
                when you’re confused or unsure about how to proceed with your code.
                <br>
                <b>YouTube videos:</b> Online videos and video tutorials are great resources that can <b>help you get
                    your head around complex concepts.</b> You should use them alongside an online course or another
                method of learning how to code for beginners.
                Or you can learn from our website <a style="color:rgb(52, 60, 180)" href="Home.html">CodersByte</a>.
            </p> <br>
            <h3>Step 4: Download A Code Editor</h3>
            <p>Although a lot of online courses let you write code in a code editor directly in your browser, you need
                to realize that this isn’t how it works in the real world. Once you graduate from your online course,
                you will need to <b>start writing your code directly into a code editor,</b> so it’s a good idea to
                start practicing doing this now.

                Most programming languages have their code editors that you can download. They usually come complete
                with interactive development environments (IDEs) that will <b>help you build clear, error-free code</b>.
                Simple languages like HTML and CSS can be written straight into a simple text document if you find that
                easier.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 5: Practice Writing Your Programs</h3>
            <p>Once you have a basic working knowledge of your chosen language, you will need to start creating your
                programs and projects. Although you might feel that this is a long way away right now, you will be
                surprised how fast you progress once you start learning.

                The type of program or project you start building will depend on the language you learn. For example, if
                you are learning how to code a website using HTML/CSS, you might choose to start building your website.
                emember, practice makes perfect, and practice is the key to becoming a successful programmer. Practice,
                practice, and more practice!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 6: Keep Learning</h3>
            <p>In a way, programming languages are like any other language. They require <b>regular practice</b> if you
                want to become fluent in them, and you will forget things if you don’t practice using them. It is,
                therefore essential to make sure that you keep learning new things every day.
            </p> <br>

            So there you have it - a simple 6 step guide to learning how to code for beginners. Now you have no excuses.
            Stop procrastinating, <b> stop putting it off, and get out there and start learning how to code!</b>
